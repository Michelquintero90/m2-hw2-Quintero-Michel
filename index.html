        <p>
            Hello, I'm Michel Quintero, a Colombian who arrived in the United States in Orlando in 2019. I have felt incredibly fortunate to be here and immerse myself in this new culture, which has brought about changes in my language, my family, my friends, my studies, my spiritual life, and my social activities.</p>
    <h2 style="color: blueviolet;">My Transformations Leading Me to Become a Strong Woman</h2>
         <p>
            Landed here in 2019, and when I saw the English language was basically my golden ticket, I thought, 'Â¿Por quÃ© no?' and started studying at Valencia College. In just a year, I went from 'uh-huh' to Shakespearean soliloquies, all to snag a better gig and chat up the locals without looking like a deer in the headlights.
            
            Then, in 2021, I was like, 'Â¿Por quÃ© no seguir?' and decided to throw a master's in Public Relations at UF into the mix. Now, I'm this decision-making maestro, boldly chasing dreams even when the paths look like a maze designed by a 'gato malo'. I've mastered solo travel, embraced solo explorations (like the time I outsmarted a vending machine â€“ no biggie), upgraded my woman game, and even added 'surfera' to my resume. I've taken on adventures â€“ parapente, parasailing, paracaidismo â€“ it's a wonder I'm not mistaken for a Colombian action movie star.
            
            Oh, and did I mention I've developed a deep love affair with arte, museums, concerts, studying, working... you name it? All of this has turned me into a powerhouse of a 'paisa'. In my past life, I probably couldn't even win a game of Monopolio without shedding a tear. La vida es un chiste, and I'm rocking it with strength and a side of laughter! ðŸ’ªðŸ˜„</p>
